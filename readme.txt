== Description ==

Kouguu FB Like wraps the new *Facebook Like Button* plugin into a customizable WP plugin:

"The Like button enables users to make connections to your pages and share content back
to their friends on Facebook with one click. Since the content is hosted by Facebook,
the button can display personalized content whether or not the user has logged into your site.
For logged-in Facebook users, the button is personalized to highlight friends who have also liked the page."

Visit http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like for more details on this feature.
